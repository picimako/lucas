This product includes software developed at
The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).

Many classes are reused from the Luke subproject of the Apache Lucene (https://github.com/apache/lucene) project.
Those classes are placed either under the 'com.picimako.org.apache.lucene.luke...' package structure corresponding
to their original packages, or in their original packages when no other option is available.
